# EPL_Ranking_System

This is the final project of INFO6205 Data Structure and Algorithm class.

## Project Description

This project is aim to predict 2019/20 EPL final result. We use Poisson distribution to simulate the possible outcome of one match. To make this prediction more accurate, we also consider the home team advantage.

The ranking system will generate the score for each match and give out the final rank table.

## Project Structure
